        <li> 1 tsp sea salt </li>
        <li> Black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Step-by-step instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the creamy cauliflower sauce, take a large microwaveable bowl, tip in the cauliflower florets and diced onions, cover and microwave on full power for 8-9 minutes until the florets are tender.</li>
            <li>Pour into a blender or food processor, (or just use a hand-blender in the bowl), add the milk, garlic, mustard, flour and salt, and blitz to a smooth sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning as required. Set aside.</li>
            <li>For the broccoli & kale layer: take a second large, microwaveable bowl and tip in the broccoli, kale and diced onions. Add 2 tablespoon water, cover and microwave on full power for 9-10 minutes until the broccoli is tender. Drain through a sieve or colander, squeezing out as much moisture as possible with a fork, then mash the florets into small pieces (or use a sharp knife to break them up a bit).</li>
            <li>For the garlic bread crust: toast the slice of bread. In a mini chopper, blender or food processor, blitz the toast, nuts/seeds, garlic, parsley and olive oil together to form crumbs.</li>
            <li>To layer the lasagne: tip half of the broccoli & kale mixture into the bottom of an ovenproof dish, then pour over half the passata. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, then cover with a layer of lasagne sheets.</li>
